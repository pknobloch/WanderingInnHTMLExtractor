# WanderingInnHTMLExtractor
A quick utility to help me extract the inner HTML from a web-novel I'm reading. The input and output path is **hard-coded** (yeah, I know - it's naughty). I used http://pandoc.org to stitch the HTML together to create an EPUB file to read on my phone.

Maybe this will help someone (or me when Volume 6 is complete).
